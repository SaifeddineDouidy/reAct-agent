# ReAct Agent for Gemini 🚀

## Project Description 📝
This project implements a **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)** agent designed to interact with Google's **Gemini Large Language Model (LLM)**. The agent is capable of processing user queries, reasoning about the best course of action, and utilizing external tools (like Google Search and Wikipedia) to gather information before formulating a comprehensive answer. It exposes a **Flask API** for seamless interaction. 🌐

## Features ✨
* **ReAct Pattern Implementation**: Leverages the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) prompting strategy for enhanced LLM capabilities. 🧠
* **Gemini LLM Integration**: Optimized for interaction with Google's Gemini models via Vertex AI. 🌟
* **Tool Use**: Integrates external tools such as Google Search (via SerpAPI) and Wikipedia for information retrieval. 🔍
* **Conversation Memory**: Maintains a history of interactions to provide context-aware responses. 🗂️
* **Caching**: Implements an in-memory cache for tool results to reduce redundant API calls and improve performance. ⚡
* **Repetition Detection**: Prevents infinite loops by detecting repetitive agent actions. 🔄
* **Structured Logging and Tracing**: Provides detailed logs and traces of the agent's thought process and actions. 📊
* **Flask API**: Exposes a RESTful API for easy integration with frontend applications. 🖥️
* **Pydantic Models**: Uses Pydantic for robust data validation and serialization of agent states, messages, and tool responses. ✅

## Architecture
The ReAct agent operates on a loop of "Thought," "Action," and "Observation."

### Components:
* **Agent**: The core orchestrator, managing the ReAct loop, state, memory, and tool interactions. 🤖
* **Gemini LLM**: The brain of the agent, responsible for generating thoughts, deciding on actions, and formulating answers. 💡
* **Tools**: External services (e.g., SerpAPI for Google Search, Wikipedia API) that the agent can invoke to gather information. 🛠️
* **MemoryManager**: Stores and manages the conversation history. 📚
* **ToolCache**: Caches results from tool invocations to optimize performance. ⚙️
* **RepetitionDetector**: Monitors agent actions to prevent repetitive loops. 🚫
* **Flask API**: Provides the interface for external applications to interact with the agent. 🌍

## Setup and Installation 🛠️

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.10+ 🐍
* Poetry (for dependency management) 📦
* Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI API enabled ☁️
* SerpAPI Key (for Google Search functionality) 🔑

### 1. Clone the repository 📥
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/react-agent.git](https://github.com/SaifeddineDouidy/reAct-agent)
cd reAct-agent
```

### 2. Install dependencies using Poetry 📦
```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
```

### 3. Configure Google Cloud Credentials ☁️
Ensure your Google Cloud credentials are set up. You can either:
* Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key JSON file. 🔑
* Place your service account key JSON file at `./credentials/key.json` (as configured in `config/config.yml`).

### 4. Configure SerpAPI Key 🔐
Obtain a SerpAPI key from [serpapi.com](https://serpapi.com/).
Create or update the `./credentials/key.yml` file with your SerpAPI key:
```yaml
serp:
  key: YOUR_SERPAPI_KEY
```

### 5. Initialize Vertex AI ⚙️
The `src/config/setup.py` file handles Vertex AI initialization. Ensure your `project_id` and `region` are correctly set in `config/config.yml`.

## Configuration ⚙️
The main configuration is located in `config/config.yml`:

```yaml
project_id: your-gcp-project-id
credentials_json: ./credentials/key.json
region: us-central1
model_name: gemini-2.5-flash # Or other Gemini models like gemini-pro 🌟
```

You can also adjust agent-specific parameters within `src/react/agent.py` in the `create_agent` function, such as `max_iterations`, `confidence_threshold`, `cache_ttl`, and `max_history_size`. 🛠️

## Usage 🚀

### Running the Flask API 🌐
To start the ReAct agent API server:
```bash
python src/react/agent.py
```
The server will run on `http://0.0.0.0:5000` (default).

### Interacting with the API 🤝
You can interact with the agent using `curl` or any API client.

#### Ask a Query ❓
**Endpoint**: `POST /ask`
**Body**: `{"query": "Your question here"}`

Example:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "Who is the current president of the United States?"}' http://localhost:5000/ask
```

#### Get Conversation History 📜
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/conversations`

Example:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/conversations
```

## API Endpoints 🌐

* **POST /ask**: Submits a query to the ReAct agent and receives a response. ❓
    * **Request Body**: `{"query": "string"}`
    * **Response Body**: `{"response": "string", "status": "success" | "error"}`
* **GET /api/conversations**: Retrieves the current conversation history. 📚
    * **Response Body**: `[{"role": "string", "content": "string", "timestamp": "ISO 8601 string"}]`

## Tools 🛠️

The agent is equipped with the following tools:

* **Google Search (SerpAPI)** 🔎:
    * **Description**: Performs web searches for current information and general web results.
    * **Usage**: Used for queries requiring up-to-date information, specific facts, or broad web content.
    * **Implementation**: `src/tools/serp.py`
* **Wikipedia Search** 📖:
    * **Description**: Fetches factual information, biographies, and summaries from Wikipedia.
    * **Usage**: Ideal for historical facts, definitions, and detailed information on known entities.
    * **Implementation**: `src/tools/wiki.py`

## Logging and Tracing 📊
The agent provides comprehensive logging and tracing to help understand its decision-making process.
* **Application Logs**: `logs/app.log` 🗒️
* **Execution Traces**: `data/output/trace.txt` (records the agent's thoughts, actions, and observations for each iteration). 📜
